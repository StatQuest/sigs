# The StatQuest Illustrated Guide to Statistics

Hello! I'm [Josh Starmer](https://www.youtube.com/@statquest) and welcome to the github repository for my book, **[The StatQuest Illustrated Guide to Statistics]()**. Here are the coding tutorials associated with each chapter. Enjoy!

**Shameless Self Promotion!!!!** If you don't already have **[The StatQuest Illustrated Guide to Statistics]()**, you should get it! The book starts with the basics, calculating summary statistics and drawing histograms and then builds from there, one step at a time, until you have mastered the concepts behind Linear Regression, t-tests, ANOVA and ANCOVA. Furthermore, putting the theory into practice is easy because each major concept is paired with a Python and R tutorial. **BAM!**
