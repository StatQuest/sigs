However, since we want the normal distribution to overlap the histogram, the first thing we need to do is call the `histplot()` function again to redraw it. However, this time when we call `hist()`, we'll set `stat='density'` so that the columns represent the density of the values. This will ensure that the columns are on the same scale as the density function we use to draw the normal distribution.\n",
