Of specific interest to us right now, however, are two bits close to the bottom: `Multiple R-squared:  0.4488` and `p-value: 0.5327`. For now, just know that **Multiple R-squared** is just another way to say **R-squared**, and, in this case, the $R^2$ value for our linear regression is 0.4488, which rounds to 0.45. The summary also tells us that the *p*-value for that $R^2$ is 0.5327, which rounds to 0.54. In other words, using the standard threshold for staistical significance, 0.05, we would fail to reject the Null Hypothesis that there is no relationshiop between the number of stores a company has and its revenue. That's a little bit of a bummer, but, it could be that there is a relationship, but that we just don't have enough data to be confident in saying so.\n",

The next two columns, **Std. Error** and **t value**, are not super interesting right now, but the last column **Pr(>|t|)** is. What this tells us that is the *p*-value for each parameter testing the Null Hypothesis that the parameter value is actually 0.\n",

This tells us that even though our estimate for the y-axis intercept is non-zero, we can't be confident that it really is.\n",
